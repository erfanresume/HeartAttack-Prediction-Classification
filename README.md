# HeartAttack-Prediction-Classification
In this project, I predict whether a patient has a low or high chance of having a heart attack using classification. Also i have implemeted this project with two models which i have mentioned the details below:
## Models 
### SVM
- I have used these kernels: {'rbf','poly','sigmoid','linear'}
### Logistic Regression
- I have used these solvers: {'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'newton-cg', 'newton-cholesky', 'sag', 'saga'}
